This is where i will upload every new .zip archive of WinTool.

The archive will contain 3 files
* WinTool.exe
* AutoUpdater.exe
* ThemeConfig.ini

To fully activate WinTool and use all of the features includes you have to get a license.

You can get a license by applying for one inside the "Activate" form inside WinTool by clicking "Apply for license" and donate a sum of anything above 5$ or 5€.

The license you will recieve is for 1 PC / Lifetime Access but it will be bound to your hardware, meaning that if you are to change hardware or your PC you need to contact me and i will need to reset your hardware id (there will be a fee of 5$ or 5€.

If you'd like licenses for more than 1 PC please consider donating a higher amount and stating it when you apply for the license.
